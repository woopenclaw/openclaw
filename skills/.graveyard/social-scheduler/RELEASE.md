## 🌟 Impact Numbers

**If 100 OpenClaw agents use this:**
- **Savings**: $29-99/month × 100 = **$2,900-9,900/month**
- **Per year**: **$34,800-118,800** saved by community
- **Over 5 years**: **$174,000-594,000** total savings

**That's real money staying in the community.**

## 🚧 Known Limitations

**Not Yet Supported:**
- Instagram (no public API - needs browser automation)
